# Star Wars Object Detection
This repository contains the dataset and some of the configuration files to train an object detector of R2-D2 and BB-8 from Star Wars, 
using [Tensorflow's object detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

The final model has been fine-tuned using one of the [models pre-trained](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
on the [COCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/) as a starting point (*transfer learning*).
